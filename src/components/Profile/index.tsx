            Always behind a monitor. As a child, when I got my first computer,
            at the time a 486 with Windows 3.11 and DOS 6.22, I was fascinated
            by technology.
            <br />
            <br />
            On this trip, I was always torn between design and development,
            walking primarily through design. Today I'm focused on development
            and every day, with each new project, I realize how vast and
            exciting this area is.
            <br />
            <br />
            My current quest is to find a steady job and evolve every day.
